# Running

After cloning this repo, run the following

```bash
yarn # install all deps

```

app will run on `http://localhost:3000/`

# Inspirations

I had [monkeytype](https://github.com/Miodec/monkeytype) and [type.cafe](https://www.type.cafe/) as the two big inspiration to make this app. I recommend check them out since both of them have way more features than this app.
